Question #3 - If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

I love the fact that python uses indentation instead of curly braces like most other programming languages and having moved from Java to python recently I have to admit that the code looks a lot cleaner.

However, I sometimes forget to place the <b>:</b> (colon) at the end of the statements and the compiler throws an error. The thing that I would like to change about python is the fact that I must place a ":" at the end of statements.

It will not make any significant difference if we use indentation itself as the delimiter. It would save our valuable time which can be used on debugging other segments of the code if they have an error.
