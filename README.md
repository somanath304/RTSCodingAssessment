# RTSCodingExercise
Question # 1 - Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

Solution in <b>above_below.py</b>

Question # 2 - Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

Solution in <b>rotate_string.py</b>

Question #3 - If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

<b>I love the fact that python uses indentation instead of curly braces like most other programming languages and having moved from Java to python recently I have to admit that the code looks a lot cleaner.

However, I sometimes forget to place the <b>:</b> (colon) at the end of the statements and the compiler throws an error. The thing that I would like to change about python is the fact that I must place a ":" at the end of statements.

It will not make any significant difference if we use indentation itself as the delimiter. It would save our valuable time which can be used on debugging other segments of the code if they have an error.</b>
